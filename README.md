# TangyBlazor
End of April / begin 2022. After completion the MVC courses and being busy building the API for the Bouwmarkt assignment, I went back to studying Blazor. Being enthousiastic about Bhrugen Patel's courses I bought his Blazor Bootcamp - .NET 6 (WASM and Server) course. I learned the fundamentals of Blazor, including Forms in Blazor with Validation, built a real world e-commerce application using Blazor Web Assembly and Blazor Server, build a .NET 6 API from scratch, consume a .NET 6 API using Blazor WASM, Authentication & authorization in Blazor Server and WASM, Emails with Blazor, Intergrate Stripe Payments in Blazor WASM, Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection, Syncfusion and Randzen Blazor Components, Blazored Local Stooge and much and much more to build a complete e-commerce web application using Blazor Server, WASM and .NET 6(.NET/EF Core) API.
