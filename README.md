# TangyBlazor
End of April / begining of May 2022 (after completion the MVC courses and being busy building the API for the Bouwmarkt assignment) I went back studying Blazor. For years that JavaScript frameworks have dominated the front end/client side development, I personally think things are going to change with Blazor. Being enthousiastic about Bhrugen Patel's courses I decided to buy his Blazor Bootcamp - .NET 6 (WASM and Server) Udemy course. In this course I learned the fundamentals of Blazor, including Forms in Blazor with Validation, built a real world e-commerce application using Blazor Web Assembly and Blazor Server, build a .NET 6 API from scratch, consume a .NET 6 API using Blazor WASM, Authentication & authorization in Blazor Server and WASM, Emails with Blazor, Intergrate Stripe Payments in Blazor WASM, Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection, Syncfusion and Randzen Blazor Components, Blazored Local Stooge and much and much more and eventely built a (over-)complete e-commerce web application. This is the result.
